# Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a passionate data scientist currently enrolled in the Master's program in Data Science at Georgia Tech. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from James Madison University (JMU), where I developed a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. Furthering my expertise, I earned an Applied Data Science Certificate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which solidified my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

My passion for data science is driven by a deep curiosity about how data can be used to uncover insights and solve complex problems. I am particularly fascinated by the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and I am committed to leveraging these technologies to drive innovation and improve human activities. I am excited about the potential of upcoming technologies such as deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to revolutionize various industries and enhance our daily lives.
